# Problem Description [Michelle Wetterwald, Marc Girod-Genet]

In this section, we describe the probelm space in which semantics can be applied, in particular why it is needed to provide platform, system or domain interoperability.

Several studies have demonstrated the fragmentation of the IoT eco-system in terms of standardization, available technologies and M2M service platforms. Accordingly, measurements and data available in one system or implementation are often not accessible by a different system. Furthermore, these systems and the data they handle are often still strongly dependent of the vertical domain in which they are implemented. 

Interoperability has been considered at various levels: technical (connectivity, network, syntactic), informational (semantic or business context) or even organizational. Technical levels cannot be easily achieved when addressing integrated platforms. The semantic or data level is thus the next level where interoperability can be envisioned. Furthermore, the different systems must share the same vocabulary and understand in an identical manner the information they exchange, while facilitating the design of service compositions. 

There is a need for a common model that describes a system and its components and can be understood by different implementations and plarforms. It should provide a formalized specification of that system, including its main concepts, the relationship between its main components and their attributes. It should indicate the meaning of the data shared by a device, which can be understood by machines from different origins. Semantic interoperability enables interoperability at data level between platforms and IoT systems, but also between verticals domains. When an ontology is defined for one device from a vertical domain, e.g. agriculture, a generic interworking is made possible, i.e. the data it shares can be understood by machines and devices operating in other domains, for example smart mobility or smart city. It enables the IoT applications to make smarter decisions because they are able to collect, understand the meaning and process data from all sorts of devices. In that context, there is no further need to develop one-to-one interfaces and less risk to make errors when using external data.

Semantics and ontology definition can bring a valuable solution, as it defines a common and abstracted sub-layer above the services and platforms definition. Semantics interoperability thus enable the sharing of data across systems, avoiding the definition of a new common data model every time two different systems need to exchange information or the costly misinterpretation of data received from an external system.

As already aforementioned, one of the first interoperability level to take care of is at informational level, i.e. at data and semantic level. It is mandatory to address since it allows data heterogeneity management, both within a single platform and even across platforms (provided that the data model becomes a unified / standardized one). One good example of that is the Bluetooth LE GATT (Low Energy Generic Attributes) profile that has been standardized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and enables interoperability of Bluetooth devices [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt].

Figure 1: Simple example of a house room

Let us now take the simple problem of a house room with a black box on a wall (see figure 1), e.g. a sensor that is providing the following instant value: 22°. A visitor of the house has as much power of reasoning as humams do and is therefore guessing (due to the position of the black box, the value provided on the black Box screen  ̶  22°  ̶ , his central European location) that the provided value is a temperature expressed in degree Celcius. A machine (e.g. a Device, an automated process, an application…) for its part is not able to do a lot with this instant value (22°) since it does not know how to analyze this raw data, mainly:

•	the meaning of the data, called metadata, e.g. in our home example a temperature measurement, with “Temperature” as name, ‘t’ as acronym, “°C” as unit of measure, “float” as measurement domain and 22 as value. With this metadata knowledge, few simple data analytics can already be performed, like e.g. in our home example, verifying if a  Temperature ‘t’ is not higher than 26,

•	and the context of the data, extending the metadata and called ontology, like e.g. in our home example, the information of the sensor that provides the data, the associated positioning and geolocalization, environment, room and home ID, home owner information. With that extended semantic knowledge, more powerful semantic data analytics can now be performed, like e.g. in our home example, which are the collocated houses that have the same Temperature value. 

Ontology design (i.e. specification, formalization) and implementation are thus mandatory for data heterogeneity management and semantic interoperability. It facilitates data/information sharing across systems and enables semantic-based embedded data analytics (e.g. for automated alarm management or control operations). If the ontology incorporates common upper level semantics, like e.g. service definition, then it enables data sharing at application level and also facilitates cross-domain use cases handling.

The specification of a semantic data model corresponds to the definition of concepts that characterize the data and its environment, associated with the links between those concepts. This is generally materialized through a diagram/graph where the concepts correspond to classes or tree nodes, and relations correspond to tree edges labeled by the relation type. For the simple example depicted in Figure 1, the black box on the wall is e.g. a device (this is a first concept) that makes a measurement (this is a second concept, linked to the first one by the relation ‘makes’). Concerning the formalization of the data model, this corresponds to the transcription of its corresponding concepts and their relations within a formalized description language. This computing description language insures in particular that the data model is readable and interpretable by both machines (e.g. Devices, automated processes, applications…) and humans in a unique and unambiguous way.

Next sections show, using a specific use case, how semantic interoperability can be implemented and deployed.
