# Overall Guidance
Target Audience: Developers, System Architects

Goal: Show how to implement semantic solutions and to achieve semantic interoperability

Give an overview of strengths when using semantic technologies.

Abstractions, hiding some aspects to make applications easier (but keeping key advantages).

Introduce existing tools, how they can be applied.

Point to relevant standard.

Show a small, but relevant example, e.g. cross-domain.

# Introduction [Martin Bauer]
[Introduction.md](part2/Introduction.md)

# Problem Description [Michelle Wetterwald]
Describe the problem space in which semantics can be applied in more detail.

[Problem_Description.md](part2/Problem_Description.md)

# Example Use Case [Laura Daniele]
Describe an example use case that instantiates the problem space, is as simple as possible, but shows the advantages of semantics and can be used in the following subsections.
