# 1 Towards a business practice of semantic Interoperability
Part 1 provides a rationale for a business practice of semantic interoperability, identifies conditions under which it can take place, and describes a semantic interoperability process, i.e. an interoperability-by-design practice.
## 1.1 Rationale for a business practice
The benefit of applying semantic interoperability processes to business will be the following:
* A systematic process is applied, which improves the quality of a specification
* The resulting specification can be used as a reference when interpretation problems have to be solved
* Most importantly, the maintenance and extension of an interoperability specification will be straightforward with a better guarantee that no regression is created.
## 1.2 Business requirements for semantic interoperability specification development
In order to get successful standards on semantic interoperability specifications, a number of requirements must be taken in account by organisations that wish to build a standard:
* Co-creation and separation of concern
* Scope of a specification
* Evaluation of a specification
* Support of business deployment concerns
### Co-creation and separation of concern
The practice of semantic interoperability requires multiple expertise: domain experts bring knowledge on domain engineering, semantic interoperability experts bring knowledge on ontology engineering. Depending on the business, other categories of experts might also be needed such as security and privacy exerts, or user-centric design experts.
It is however important to achieve a clear separation of concern between domain experts and semantic interoperability experts. Without this separation of concern, we can get into the trap that a domain expert has to rely on a semantic interoperability expert to propose a specification, and end up with decisions that are taken by the wrong expert. From a method and tools viewpoint, we believe that recommendations must be provided in approaches to create separation of concern. An example of good separation of concern was achieved by the SAREF team when they organized a session for the European Large Scale Pilots during the IoT week in Bilbao in June 2018 to get input from domain experts that they could use in the specification of an ontology. We believe that we still lack good practices, recommendations and tools on how this separation of concern takes place. For instance, domain experts should be able to inspect and update a specification using a domain viewpoint, while the semantic interoperability experts should be able to focus on the semantic interoperability mechanics soundness.

| Example of practice integrating separation of concern | An example of good separation of concern is to have specific co-creation sessions when both categories are present to make design decision. This was achieved by the SAREF team when they organized a session for the European Large Scale Pilots during the IoT week in Bilbao in June 2018 to get input from domain experts that they could use in the specification of an ontology. |
### Evaluation of a specification
It is important to be able to evaluate the “usefulness” of a specification. One typical indicator is the level of consensus. A specification that has not reached consensus is likely not to be adopted. Semantic interoperability standards can fall into this trap if the domain experts get lost in the specification process. The goal should be that domain experts can constantly follow the specification process and agree on the content while semantic interoperability experts guarantee that the specification is sound.
### Deployment concerns
It is important to be able to take into account deployment concerns in a specification of a semantic interoperability standard. At least two concerns should be taken into account:
* Provision for profiles and discovery. Some specifications might concern a market segment of a domain. For instance, high-end device manufacturers might want to add specific semantic specification concerning high-end features. Some specifications might even be proprietary. This can happen when device manufacturers agree that they will agree on co-existing solutions. This is often solved by service discovery capabilities. The concept of profiles should also be applied to semantic interoperability standards
* Support for version management. Semantic interoperability specifications will evolve as a domain evolves to match the needs of different generations of products (e.g., a new generation of smartphone) The rules for compatibility must be anticipated. For instance, we could have a SAREF v1 ontology for a domain that is then replaced by SAREF v2 ontology Rules [Amélie: not clear] for allowing this evolution must be agreed upfront.
## 1.2 Avoiding fragmentation of semantic interoperability specifications by promoting a system viewpoint
The table below describes a number of important initiatives on semantic interoperability. While it is important to foster such developments, there is a need for convergence in order to avoid the following risks:
* Risk of lack of interoperability caused by the use of incompatible specification languages. 
* Babel tower situation [amélie: i know a little bit about this, but not clear here] caused by the specification of incompatible semantics.
* Fragmentation [amélie: lack of interoperability? what is fragmentation] caused by incompatible system approaches. 
A system viewpoint should be taken as proposed by SAREF in Figure 1.

| Initiative | Description |
|----|----|
| W3C Semantic Sensor Networks | As depicted in the previous table, there is no common benchmark to evaluate all the triple-stores. However, the selection of a triple store will be fundamentally based on the type of inferencing you need in the project (RDF, RDFS, OWL), the type of the project (commercial or open source) and the initial information capacity expected for your application. Other key aspects to have in mind at time of selecting a semantic store is the performance capacity. That means, how the semantic store perform the inferences and where the information is stored. A big lack of the semantic stores is that they needs huge resources to perform the corresponding inferencing, process and load the information. This main lack is derived mainly by the mix of storing the information in different files and in-memory. | 
| W3C Web of Things | The Web of Things (WoT) is an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) to ease the access to data using the benefits of Web technologies [2]. Data is generated by things/devices and then exploited by more and more web-based applications to monitor healthcare or even control home automation devices. The W3C Web of Things (WoT) Interest Group is designing a vocabulary to describe interactions between objects through the Web, a potential implementation is the WoT ontology [4]. At the current date of writing, WoT ontology is not aligned with W3C SSN ontologies. A healthcare scenario has been designed "Remote health monitoring system" [5] among several use cases. |
| OneM2M | OneM2M, an international standard for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) with the development of the OneM2M ontology [6]. It extends the European ETSI M2M standard. At the current date of writing, OneM2M is not aligned with W3C SSN. | 
| MyOntoSens | MyOntoSens modular ontology, mainly based on SSN V1 and OGC standards, has been proposed in [Nachabe et al. 2015] as an improvement of existing WSNs ontologies. It has been standardized in 2015 for medical devices and BANs (Body Area Networks) as a Technical Specification (TS) within the SmartBAN Technical Committee of the ETSI standardization body [7]. This ontology is in particular relevant to build health, wellbeing/wellness and personal safety applications based on smart devices.| 
| SAREF| Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) [8], is a European standard supported by ETSI M2M and SmartM2M. It mainly covers the smart building applicative domain. The SAREF ontology has been designed re-using SSN and oneM2M according to [Moreira et al. 2017]. Schema.org. Schema.org is a well-known schema catalog to structure data on Web pages to describe the location, person, etc. The IoT Schema.org extension [9] is planned; discussions are ongoing. | 
| Haystack | Haystack [10] is a project aiming at standardizing semantic data models and web services. For instance, the Haystack Tagging Ontology which employs SSN V1 ontology has been developed [11] [Charpenay et al. 2015].| 


 ## 1.3 Example
This section could provide an example on Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). It would demonstrate a use case combining 2 domains: smart homes and healthcare applications domains. AAL helps elderly people to stay independent at home.

 ## 1.4 Roadmap proposal
Drawing from the recommendations, this section could provide a proposed roadmap.

# Additional text from previous contributors
